# Euchre_project
Text based euchre. Can have four humans play or play against computers (or atleast, that's the plan)

There are different verisions here, the most up to date one is euchre2.py

- Dealt with input validation
- Learned more about classes and subclasses
- Learned how to map out a project before actually coding, to help the process
